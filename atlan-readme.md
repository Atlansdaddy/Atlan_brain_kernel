# Atlan Brain Kernel

A revolutionary field-based cognitive architecture that models intelligence as emergent resonance patterns rather than traditional computation.

## Overview

The Atlan Brain Kernel represents a fundamentally different approach to artificial intelligence:

- **No Neural Networks**: Uses resonance propagation instead of backpropagation
- **No Transformers**: Uses spatial field dynamics instead of attention mechanisms  
- **No Rules Engine**: Intelligence emerges from field interactions

### Core Innovation

Intelligence emerges from wave-like energy propagation through a 3D cognitive field, where:
- Nodes represent concepts in spatial positions
- Energy resonance creates memory and associations
- Decay models forgetting
- Reinforcement strengthens important knowledge
- Identity emerges from stable patterns

## Installation

### Requirements

```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib
```

### Quick Start

1. Save the `atlan_brain_kernel.py` file
2. Run the demo:

The system builds through 21 stages of increasing cognitive capability:

1. **Basic Resonance** - Energy propagation between nodes

## Usage Guide

### Basic Usage

```python
from atlan_brain_kernel import FullCognitiveAgent

# Create a brain
brain = FullCognitiveAgent(initial_size=10)

# Add knowledge nodes
brain.add_node((0, 0, 0), "biology", "Plant")
brain.add_node((1, 0, 0), "biology", "Tree")
brain.add_node((1, 1, 0), "biology", "Apple Tree")

# Add semantic relationships
brain.add_semantic_link("Apple Tree", "Tree")
brain.add_semantic_link("Tree", "Plant")

# Propagate learning energy
brain.propagate_resonance((1, 1, 0), input_energy=5.0, importance_weight=0.75)

# Consolidate memories
brain.replay_memory_chain()

# Form abstractions
abstractions, _ = brain.derive_abstractions(abstraction_threshold=1.0)

# Run autonomous life cycles
brain.run_life_cycle(cycles=5)
```

### Advanced Features

#### Conflict Resolution
```python
# Detect conflicting beliefs
conflicts = [("Fruit", "Food"), ("Plant", "Tree")]
brain.detect_conflicts(conflicts, threshold=0.25)
brain.resolve_conflicts()
```

#### Meta-Learning
```python
# Evaluate learning strategies
strategies = {
    "Exploit Known": 0.6,
    "Balanced": 1.0,
    "Explore Unknown": 1.4
}
brain.evaluate_strategies(strategies)
brain.select_best_strategy()
```

#### Identity Formation
```python
# Build persistent identity
brain.form_identity_model(core_threshold=1.0)
print(f"Core identity: {brain.identity_core}")
```

### Visualization

```python
# 3D visualization of the cognitive field
brain.visualize_nodefield()
```

## Key Concepts

### Energy Propagation Formula

```
E_transfer = E_input × W × Dampening × (1 / (distance² + ε))
```

Where:
- `E_input`: Initial energy
- `W`: Importance weight (0.0 - 1.0)
- `Dampening`: Energy loss factor (typically 0.5)
- `distance`: Euclidean distance between nodes
- `ε`: Small constant to avoid division by zero

### Memory Stabilization

The system naturally models phenomena like PTSD through high-energy event stabilization:
- High importance (W=1.0) creates persistent memories
- Decay suppression proportional to energy level
- Reactivation sensitivity emerges naturally

### Abstraction Formation

Concepts that maintain energy above threshold become abstractions:
- Repeated exposure strengthens concepts
- Related concepts cluster spatially
- Hierarchies emerge from semantic links

## Customization

### Adding New Domains

```python
# Add a new knowledge domain
emotion_nodes = {
    (10, 10, 10): "Joy",
    (10, 11, 10): "Happiness", 
    (11, 10, 10): "Sadness",
    (11, 11, 10): "Grief"
}

for pos, emotion in emotion_nodes.items():
    brain.add_node(pos, "emotion", emotion)
```

### Custom Learning Events

```python
# Define importance weights
importance_weights = {
    "survival_critical": 1.0,
    "mission_critical": 0.75,
    "medium": 0.5,
    "low": 0.25,
    "noise": 0.05
}

# Apply weighted learning
brain.propagate_resonance(
    source_position=(10, 10, 10),
    input_energy=5.0,
    importance_weight=importance_weights["mission_critical"]
)
```

### Tuning Parameters

Key parameters to adjust:

- `decay_factor`: How quickly memories fade (0.0-1.0)
- `threshold`: Activation energy required (typically 1.0)
- `dampening`: Energy transfer loss (0.0-1.0)
- `abstraction_threshold`: Minimum energy for abstraction
- `exploration_threshold`: Curiosity trigger level

## Theory & Philosophy

### Why Field-Based Cognition?

Traditional AI approaches treat intelligence as computation. Atlan treats it as emergent field dynamics, more closely modeling how biological brains actually work:

1. **Distributed Representation**: Knowledge isn't stored in specific locations but emerges from patterns
2. **Natural Forgetting**: Unused knowledge naturally decays
3. **Associative Learning**: Proximity in the field creates associations
4. **Emergent Behavior**: Complex cognition arises from simple rules

### Biological Inspiration

The architecture mirrors several brain mechanisms:
- **Neural assemblies** → Node chains
- **Synaptic plasticity** → Energy modulation
- **Cortical columns** → Spatial regions
- **Memory consolidation** → Replay cycles
- **Attention** → Energy focusing

### Future Directions

Potential extensions include:
- Sensory input integration
- Motor output generation
- Social modeling with multiple agents
- Language acquisition layers
- Emotional modeling
- Creativity emergence
